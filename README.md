# About
This code was developed during the early 2000's prior to Throne of Destiny. I held on to it privately for more than a decade. When I heard Asheron's Call was nearing an end, I updated it to work with Throne of Destiny. The primary functionality included is the ability to explore dungeons and the landscape.
